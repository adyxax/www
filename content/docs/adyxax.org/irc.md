## Introduction

I have been hosting a private irc chat server since 2009 for myself and some geek friends. It is a simple standalone [ngircd](https://ngircd.barton.de/) server, no backups necessary.

There is a Server to Server configuration commented bellow that I use when migrating from host to host.
