## Introduction

git.adyxax.org is a [gitea](https://gitea.io/) instance. For about 10 years I used a gitolite installation but I finally went for a gui instead in order to host repositories for non tech people.

## Captain's log

- 2021-11-12 : Migrated to a podman setup on dalinar, and from PostgreSQL to SQLite
- 2020-10-05 : Initial setup of gitea on yen.adyxax.org's OpenBSD
