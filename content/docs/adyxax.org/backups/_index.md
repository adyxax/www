description: what is backuped where and how I manage it

## Introduction

Backups are performed with the [borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool ("You will be assimilated" Star Trek vibes). It is simple, fast, storage efficient and fits my needs. I manage it thanks to a [custom made ansible role](https://git.adyxax.org/adyxax/borg-ansible-role).
