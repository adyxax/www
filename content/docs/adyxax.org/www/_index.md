## Introduction

This is the website you are currently reading. It is a static website built using [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

I often refer to it as wiki.adyxax.org because this site replaces a [dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) I used for a long time as my main website (and a [pmwiki](https://www.pmwiki.org/) before that), but with hugo it has become more than that: it is now a mix of wiki, blog and showcase of my work and interests.

For a log of how I made the initial setup, see [this blog article.]({{< ref "switching-to-hugo" >}}). Things are now simpler since I [wrote my own theme]({{< ref "ditching-the-heavy-hugo-theme" >}}).
