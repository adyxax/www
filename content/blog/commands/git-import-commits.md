## The trick

In an ideal world there should never be a need to do this, but here is how to do it properly if you ever walk into this bizarre problem. This command imports commits from a repo in the `../masterfiles` folder and applies them to the repository inside the current folder :
```sh
(cd ../masterfiles/; git format-patch â€“stdout origin/master) | git am
```
