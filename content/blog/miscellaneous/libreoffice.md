## The problem

Sometimes you have to edit a corporate document which vim cannot really open for edition and you are dumbstruck as to why the software won't just let you make your changes without jumping through hoops.

## The solution

You can choose to ignore write-protection by setting `Tools > Options > libreOffice Writer > Formatting Aids > Protected Areas > Ignore protection`. Yes, so much menu nesting for something so stupid!
