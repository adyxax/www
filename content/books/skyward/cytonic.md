This is the fourth book in the Cytoverse and takes place at the same time as [Skyward Flight]({{< ref "skyward-flight.md" >}}). Following a reading advice on reddit, I read this book right after, and then read the epilogue of the third story in Skyward Flight. Well I find that skipping the epilogue mattered that much, but Cytonic should really be read after and I am glad I did!

I quite liked this book, even more so than [Starsight]({{< ref "starsight.md" >}}). I rank it on par with the first [Skyward]({{< ref "skyward.md" >}}) novel. The space dogfights are still very well written and the tension is really palpable. The aliens we meet are so alien, meeting them felt great. If you enjoyed Skyward I really recommend reading this book!
