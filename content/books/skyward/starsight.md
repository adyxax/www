This is the second novel in the Skyward series of the author. There is a few months ellipsis after the ending of the first book and humanity managed to fight back enough to reach space, but they are still stuck on their planet and still under constant threat of extinction by aliens, but we are getting to know them!

I found this book a little weaker than the first one, though I cannot quite put my finger on why. I still liked the characters, the various settings, the spying and political plot, and the ending was satisfying. But I guess I wanted something more or something else? I still recommend reading this book.
