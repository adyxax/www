Hyperthief is a very short story taking place in the Cytoverse. I almost missed its existence but was lucky to stumble on it on [The Coppermind](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hyperthief). I quite liked this story, it was fun and refreshing to go through it and witness our favourite characters experience it. If you enjoyed skyward I recommend reading it right after [Evershore, the third story in Skyward Flight]({{< ref "skyward-flight.md" >}}).
