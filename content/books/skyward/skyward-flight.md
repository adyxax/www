This is the a collection of three novellas in the Cytoverse. Following a reading advice on reddit, I read this book between Starsight and Cytonic, but did not read the epilogue of the third story yet since it contains spoilers for Cytonic.

I quite liked this book, more so than Starsight but still I found it weaker than the first Skyward novel. It was refreshing to experience different viewpoints from Spensa, I especially enjoyed FM's story and would love to get a Kimmalyn story in the future. If you enjoyed Skyward I recommend reading this book!
