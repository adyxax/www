This is the first novel in the Skyward series of the author. It is a science fiction story about a group of humans living stranded on a planet in a far future, under constant threat of extinction by mysterious aliens.

There are lots of great characters and piloting action sequences. I find that this book hits all the right notes for me and I highly recommend reading it!
