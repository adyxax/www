I just finished listening to the audio book adaptation from Rosamund Pike of the
first book in the Wheel of Time series. I must say it was an epic experience
that I highly recommend. The narrator has a fantastic and mesmerizing voice, and
the story though a bit long in some passages, really kept me hooked.

I loved the characters and the world and cannot wait to listen to the next book.
