I just finished listening to the audio book adaptation from Rosamund Pike of the
third book in the Wheel of Time series. It was an epic experience yet again,
thanks to the mesmerizing voice and efforts of the narrator. The story took me a
bit by surprise. Though the pace, intrigue and action are all very well
written... I expected a bit more Rand viewpoints in a book named after his
character!

This is just a minor nitpick because the book kept me hooked until the very end.
I love the characters and the world even more now and cannot wait to listen to
the next book.
