I just finished listening to the audio book adaptation from Rosamund Pike of the
second book in the Wheel of Time series. It was an epic experience again, thanks
to the fantastic voice and efforts of the narrator. The story had a much better
pace than the first book and really kept me hooked until the very end.

I love the characters and the world even more now and cannot wait to listen to
the next book.
