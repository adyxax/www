This is the fourth book in the Wax and Wayne series, which takes place about a decade after the events in [The Bands of Mourning]({{< ref "the-bands-of-mourning.md" >}}). It is a captivating story that takes us on a wild chase for a doomsday device, with political machinations happening all at once! Minor spoiler but I particularly enjoyed seeing characters from Elantris's world Sel and it was fantastic to have Harmony interact more with our characters. Marasi had a great story arc, and Kelsier is still very intriguing! Wayne's humor is on point too!

I really enjoyed the continued growth of the characters, all the main cast gets so much attention and development. Such a satisfying book that I very much recommend, along with the whole Mistborn series.
