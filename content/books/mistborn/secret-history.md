Mistborn: Secret History is a short story that takes place right after Kelsier's death in [The Final Empire]({{< ref "mistborn.md" >}}). We follow him becoming a Cognitive Shadow, meeting Shards and influencing the events in the series.

I recommend this (very) short read as any time spent reading about Kelsier is a good time!
