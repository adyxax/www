This is the third book in the Wax and Wayne series, which takes place about a year after the events in [Shadows of Self]({{< ref "shadows-of-self.md" >}}). It is a captivating story that takes us on a journey far across the land, and very far into the mysteries of the 17th shard! It is fantastic to have Harmony meet a certain character, and have its point of view about being a god. Harmony still is that beloved character from the first trilogy.

I really enjoyed the growth of the characters, all the main cast gets so much attention and development. Such a satisfying book from Brandon Sanderson!
