This is the first book in the Wax and Wayne series, which takes place a few centuries after the events in [The Hero of Ages]({{< ref "the-hero-of-ages.md" >}}). It is a very different and refreshing book that I thoroughly enjoyed. You follow a Lawman and his deputy in a far west like setting with a hint of magic. They investigate crimes and kidnappings, the intrigues moves very fast from one plot point to another... the result is splendid, what a book!
