The Eleventh Metal is a short story that takes place a little before the events in [The Final Empire]({{< ref "mistborn.md" >}}). We follow Kelsier being taught allomancy while being lost after fleeing the Pits of Hathsin when he lost the love of his life and became Mistborn. He founds his new purpose that leads to the plot in the first Mistborn book.

I recommend this (very) short read as any time spent reading about Kelsier is a good time!
