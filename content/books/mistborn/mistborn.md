I started reading this book right after I finished the last Stormlight Archive book available. I was hungry for more of Brandon Sanderson's writing and was not disappointed, but it shows that he was younger and maybe less experienced when writing it. Do not get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Final Empire, but after a masterpiece like Stormlight Archive it just cannot compare favorably.

That being said the characters are interesting and fun, the world and its magic system intriguing and it is captivating enough that I struggled to put the book down. I highly recommend reading Mistborn, and cannot wait to continue this series!
