This is the second book in the Wax and Wayne series, which takes place a few months after the events in [The Alloy of Law]({{< ref "the-alloy-of-law.md" >}}). It is a more supernatural story than the first one, but the investigative skills and perspicacity of the characters are still their main tools to navigate the events in this book. We learn a lot about Harmony and his impact on the world of Scadrial. I really enjoyed the progression and growth of the characters, another great book from Brandon Sanderson!
