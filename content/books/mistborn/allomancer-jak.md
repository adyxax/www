This is another short story, which is set like a parody of Wax's adventures. The writing style is light and full of exaggerations and unnecessary drama. It does not really stand out as a must read, but we do learn a bit about how Koloss live in tribes when free of the Lord Ruler and of Ruin's influence. It is unspecified if Harmony influences their actions but I believe he would not.
