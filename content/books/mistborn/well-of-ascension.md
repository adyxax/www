This is the second book in the Mistborn series. It picks up the story one year after the events in [The Final Empire]({{< ref "mistborn.md" >}}) and is very well written. Like for the first book I believe it is a little beneath Stormlight Archive in quality, but it still is a very good read that I recommend, especially for the mysteries at the end! As usual Brandon Sanderson crafts a great ending in a mix of revelations that only instigate more questions!

One thing I find very interesting is how I would have missed the first reference to Shards by Oreseur if I had not read Stormlight Archive first. Because of that I know about the Cosmere and its deities, and I am in awe at how there are such subtle clues scattered in the stories... If felt great to get it and I am left wondering whether I should re-read the first Stormlight Archive books or not.
