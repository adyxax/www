This book is a fantastic conclusion to the series, all the events buildup comes to its conclusion here and I had great time reading it. I particularly enjoyed the chapter titled The Scouring of the Shire, coming from the movies I had no idea what I was getting into... and boy was it great!

Yes the Shire was not spared in the tragic years while our hobbit adventurers were out in the world fighting and Saruman was particularly vengeful. I think I understand why they decided to cut these events from the movies, being a relatively small scale battle after the climax of the ring's destruction... But it really shows how our adventurers have been forged by their experiences and how even a naturally peaceful people can stand up and fight when they need to.

Really this book is great in itself, but this ending after the ending was something else. I recommend reading this book so much!
