I first tried to read The Fellowship of the Ring when I was a teenager, but sadly I did not have the patience for all the descriptions. At that age I was more into the Dune and Foundation cycles which while being heavy reads featured a lot more action.

I am glad I took this book up again. I have been a fan of the Peter Jackson movies since they came out and I think it really helped me appreciate the books... and reading this made me appreciate the movies even more too! They are a tough read for sure, but still accessible if you do not try to rush it.
