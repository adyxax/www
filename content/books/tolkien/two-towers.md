I enjoyed this book even more than [Fellowship of the Ring]({{< ref "fellowship-of-the-ring" >}}), probably because there is a lot more going on. The adventures are great and the battle of Helm's Deep is fantastically written. Knowing only the movies' story I was very pleased to find Eomer fighting alongside Aragorn, his role in the books is really a lot more meaningful.

The rest of the book is really great and easy to read and follow. The tension keeps building up towards the climax that will be the events in [Return of the King]({{< ref "return-of-the-king" >}}) in a very captivating way. I highly recommend reading this masterpiece!
