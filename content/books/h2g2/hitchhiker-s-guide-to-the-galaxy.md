I enjoyed reading this classic book that gave us so many references in popular culture. The absurd is omnipresent and the situations and descriptions are really funny.

I had a really nice time reading the short chapters here and there... After reading the Lord of the Rings and [The Way of Kings]({{< ref the-way-of-kings >}}) I must say I really appreciate how easy it is to just read this book for a few minutes and put the it down without getting quite so immersed into it.
