Elantris is another fantastic book by Brandon Sanderson and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. We follow three main characters with different takes and ambitions, the antagonist relations are really a treat to follow! The plot unravels in a very interesting way and the book was very hard to put down towards the end!

The only sad thing about this book is that it currently stands alone. There are two short stories in Arcanum Unbounded that I am about to devour then that's it. I cannot wait for a sequel to Elantris!
