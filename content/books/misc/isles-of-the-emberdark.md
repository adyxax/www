This book was a surprise (I did not know it was coming so soon) and I had a
great time reading it. I loved reading [Sixth of the Dusk]({{< ref
"sixth-of-the-dusk.md" >}}) a few years back and it is fantastic to follow
Dusk's adventures again. He is such an interesting character!

This is also our first real glimpse of dragons in the Cosmere, and Starling is
awesome. Minor spoiler alert: I loved we got to see Crow again.

What a fantastic book to read, highly recommended!
