This classic of historical adventure was a real pleasure to read, all three books! I knew the story from several movie adaptations but none that I saw was that great which really contrasts with how good these books are. Here the plot moves forward at a breathtaking pace, the characters are fantastic and the intrigue is really captivating. I highly recommend reading these books!
