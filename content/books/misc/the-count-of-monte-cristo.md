After enjoying [The Three Musketeers]({{< ref "three-musketeers.md" >}}) so much
a few years ago, I have been meaning to read another of Alexandre Dumas' books.
I settled on The Count of Monte Cristo for its popularity though I have never
seem a movie adaptation of it.

I found it good, brilliant even during all the beginning. I loved all the
setting and atmosphere and the characters. The whole injustice, imprisonment,
teaching and escape were incredible but I found the middle of the book quite
boring and I had trouble finding the motivation to continue reading. My interest
picked up near the end so I won't say it is a bad book... but it is clearly
dated.
