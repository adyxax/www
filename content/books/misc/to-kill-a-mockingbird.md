I stumbled upon this book when looking for classics in order to take breaks in between fantasy books.

I did not expect much because I never read anything like it and was a little disturbed by having the viewpoint of a little girl... But after a few chapters I was hooked! This is really a great book well deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it. I hope you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
