Treasure Island is the book that is the origin of all modern pirates myths and stories, it's all there with the wooden leg and the talking parrot! It is filled with adventure, voyage and dangers and really immerses you in this seamen atmosphere. I really enjoyed reading this short novel and recommend it to anyone looking for a short and good read.
