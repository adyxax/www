Sixth of the Dusk is a very short story with an incredible atmosphere. This might be an even better introduction into the cosmere and the writing style of Brandon Sanderson than [Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell]({{< ref "shadows-for-silence-in-the-forests-of-hell.md" >}}). The characters are great, the setting is very refreshing, and well I like birds very much. I recommend this captivating short read!
