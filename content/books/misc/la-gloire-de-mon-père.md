I have been meaning to read more French classics that I did not have a chance to
enjoy in my youth. I am glad I chose to read this masterpiece next, there is
something very enjoyable about "La Gloire de mon Père" that needs to be
experienced to understand.

I thoroughly enjoyed this little slice of life from a young boy admiring his
father. It is just the preparations and the unfolding of a summer vacation. Very
little happens in the end, but the book is so well written with so many rich
metaphors that my reader's imagination was easily triggered. I suspect being a
father myself changed my perspective too: I so want to be a role model that my
daughter will look up to.
