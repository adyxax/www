I very rarely read fan fictions, but the pitch of this one was just too good.
Doctor Who meets Star Trek, I could not resist. This is a longer read than I
expected, with very good pacing, and interesting plot, faithfully depicted
familiar characters.

If you are a fan of both franchises, I highly recommend!
