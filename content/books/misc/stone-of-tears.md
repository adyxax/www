This is the second book in the Sword of Truth series, its events starting right after [Wizard's First Rule]({{< ref "wizards-first-rule.md" >}}). My appreciation of this book is mostly the same as for the first one. There are many scenes that are way too graphic and gore for my taste, I almost put down the book several times because of this but decided to skip over whole paragraphs instead.

I was really not sure I would continue this series and this feeling is still there. Although I do not regret reading this I also would not recommend it.
