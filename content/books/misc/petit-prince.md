The Little Prince is one of the classics I wanted to read for quite some time. I read it in my native french language and found it quite enjoyable. I did not really know what to expect apart from a children's book but enjoyed this invitation to imagine and free yourself from the boundaries we self inflict on our lives. Also I felt very sad at the ending and was caught by surprise by this feeling. For such a short book I was really invested in the story.
