The World of Yesterday is the memoir of the author who recounts his life from before the first world war until the middle of the second world war.

It was my first time reading a memoir and even though the author is really talented it was a bit difficult to read and follow some of the tangents and anecdotes. I admit I skipped some sections especially some passages about education in Vienna or some family anecdotes that I did not relate to.

But other than that it was really enlightening and I highly recommend this book. All the build up to the first world war, the changes in mentality because of propaganda and the fight for peace and understanding carried by the author, then the aftermath of the war followed by the build up to the second... This book gives a lot to think about.
