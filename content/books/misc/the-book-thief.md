The Book Thief is an historical fiction. It takes place during the events of the second world war and is quite a story! Sad and beautiful, the struggles of a little girl through tragedy and loss narrated by death are something to experience. It is quite heavy emotionally but there is also hope. I recommend this book, but only if you are in high spirits to begin with!
