This is the first book in the Sword of Truth series, and I mostly enjoyed it. The main characters are nice and likeable and the story mostly good besides being classic. What I did not like were (spoiler alert) 200 pages of very graphic torture and having to read in details about a kid getting cruelly killed then eaten. Really just tell me the bad guy does this or that and I will believe you, but do not make me live through 200 pages of horror: it is not fun, it is horrible!

I kept reading despite this because I was 3/4 done and hoped the ending would make it worth it... Sadly the ending was just ok so not really worth it in the end. Still it is not a bad book and maybe one day I will want to know what happens to the characters in the next book, but at this point I would not recommend reading this book. There are far better fantasy series out there.
