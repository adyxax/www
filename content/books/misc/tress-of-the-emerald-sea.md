Tress of The Emerald Sea is a novel with an incredible atmosphere of sea faring adventures. A funny thing is that the story is told a posteriori by Hoid, a character we know and love because of his involvement in all the cosmere events.

Still Hoid is not the main character, we have a diverse panel of courageous and cheerful people to accompany him. The stakes in this story are lighter than most other cosmere novels and it adds to the refreshing tone of this novel. I recommend this book especially if you are already quite familiar with the cosmere, otherwise you will miss many references.
