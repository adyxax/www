I do not often read computer related books but I felt I needed to finally read this one. I am aware it is getting a bit old and I will now read online about the latest additions to the language to have a better understanding of the current state of things. I might look into typescript too, it will depend on the complexity of what I attempt to do.

I started down this path because of my WebAssembly experimentations with [Grenade Brothers]({{< ref "grenade-brothers.md" >}}). A wasm vm is a bit limited in the interactions it can perform with the outside world and everything interesting (like opening a socket or getting the time of day) needs to be exposed through a javascript api layer. For my game this was all handled by wasm4, but if I want to try something else I will need some javascript knowledge.
