I have been a fan of the star trek tv shows and movies for many years but this was my first star trek book. I stumbled upon it by chance and enjoyed this take on the TNG universe. The characters, action and plot were very nice.

The only downside I have to note is that the books are not canon in this universe! I did not know that and because of that was a little confused by the plot at first... then extremely surprised, even shocked! One of the things I enjoy the most in star trek is the vast universe and continuity that spans centuries so it was a major disapointment. Therefore even though I enjoyed the book I do not think I will read another star trek novel.
