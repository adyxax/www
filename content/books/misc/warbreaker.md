Warbreaker is another fantastic book by Brandon Sanderson and I had a great time reading it. My favorite thing was the tangible politics explored between two cultures that spawned after a war 300 years ago. The characters will deal with the prejudice and bias that originate from this distant past and it is great to see the intrigue unravel.

It is also great to have the origin of so many mysterious characters that appear in the Stormlight Archives : Zahel, Azure, Nightblood... What a fantastic book to read!
