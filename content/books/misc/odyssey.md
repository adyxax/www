I have been meaning to try reading Homer's work for quite some time and finally did it! I do not regret reading the Odyssey but I do not really recommend it either. Being a poem it is a little difficult to read but that is not my issue with this book. I just did not like the character of Odysseus all that much. While presented as crafty and clever I found him manipulative, deceptive and so so cruel... I just could not root for him to get his way in the end.
