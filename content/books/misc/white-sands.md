White Sands is a graphic novel that I had a great time reading. Besides the Fables series I do not usually read this medium but I really enjoyed it. The artists managed to cram a lot of the thorough world building Brandon Sanderson is famous for into their drawings, with so many details to look for if you want!

Because of that I would only really recommend reading for people who are already accustomed with Brandon's work, but I am sure anyone who enjoys fantasy would enjoy this series.
