What a fantastic novel from Brandon Sanderson again! I really enjoyed the premises of this story and the fast paced constant chase in the book. This author really knows how to tie everything related to the magic system in as much plausability as possible, this makes for very interesting twists! And as usual the ending is really satisfying. I recommend this book!
