What a fantastic novel from Brandon Sanderson again! I really enjoyed the premise of this story and the fast paced chase in the book. This author really knows how to tie everything related to the magic system in as much plausability as possible, this makes for very interesting twists! As usual the characters are great and with enough backstory to satisfy one's curiosity. Cherry on the cake: the ending is really satisfying. I recommend this book!
