This is a book from a former negotiating expert of the FBI, who applies what he learnt to any situation from everyday life to business negotiations. It is really interesting and full of practical information and tips: I highly recommend anyone read it. It really empathizes how important emotional intelligence is, how to be a better listener and without manipulation still make the best of a situation for yourself.
