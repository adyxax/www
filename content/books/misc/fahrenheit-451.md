This is a very famous novel about a dystopian society that burns its books to destroy knowledge and censor everything. I took up this book because of its reputation, but I must admit I did not like it much.

It must have been a visionary book when it was released and I understand why it is famous, but I find that the writing and the story really show their age. I am glad to have read it and that it was a really short story. Had it been longer, I think I would have stopped midway without finishing it.
