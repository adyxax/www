I recommend this book to anyone willing to further its understanding of the opposite sex. Even if you are in a happy and committed relationship, there are plenty of insight to take in! And if you are not already in such relationship but wish to be, reading this book will greatly improve your chances of building a successful one.

The author has a lot of practical advice on how to understand the subtil differences in our expectations and perceptions. He goes into details at what makes us tick and I even learned a lot about myself as a man. This book is short and.easy to read, you will not regret it.
