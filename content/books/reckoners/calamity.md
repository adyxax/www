Calamity is the third novel in the Reckoners series, and comes right after [Firefight]({{< ref "firefight.md" >}}). Our heroes face their biggest challenges yet and we get to learn a lot more about the world in which they live.

This is a good novel that I really enjoyed, as action packed as the first two. The characters are still fun to follow and everything is really well paced. I recommend!
