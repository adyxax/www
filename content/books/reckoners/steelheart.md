Steelheart is the first novel in the Reckoners series. It stands apart the other books from this author by not taking place in the Cosmere, meaning the action takes place a different universe without any link to the rest of his work. It depicts a post-apocalyptic world ruled by evil superhuman people and follows a band of humans trying to make a difference.

This is a good novel that I really enjoyed. The characters are great and the action is really well paced. This was a very light read compared to mistborn or stormlight archives, which is refreshing in a way. I strongly recommend this book!
