Firefight is the second novel in the Reckoners series, and comes right after [mitosis]({{< ref "mitosis.md" >}}). Our heroes go on to fight some more super powered individuals and learn a few bits and pieces about what happened to bestow powers in the first place or the logics behind heroes weaknesses.

This is a good novel that I really enjoyed, really action packed. The characters are still fun to follow and everything is really well paced. This is still a very light read compared to other book series, but fun anyway. I recommend!
