Mitosis is a short story taking place between the first two novels in the Reckoners series. The events in this story happen right after the ending of [Steelheart]({{< ref "Steelheart.md" >}}) and are a nice piece of action.

This is a good short read that I really enjoyed. The bad guy is silly and great and provides a satisfying struggle for our heroes.
