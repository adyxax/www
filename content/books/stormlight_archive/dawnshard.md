Dawnshard is a small novel (like [Edgedancer]({{< ref "edgedancer" >}})) featuring Rysn who is a side character from several interludes, Leopen and other minor characters. They all go on a crazy adventure, very well written a packed with revelations about the cosmere!

I cannot say much without spoiling but it is a must read! This book comes before [Rhythm of War]({{< ref "rhythm-of-war" >}}) but I did not know of this book at the time so I read those out of order. It is not such a big deal, but if you have the choice I recommend you respect the order for additional effect!
