This book is just another masterpiece from Brandon Sanderson. The story takes a turn and gets yet darker, but it is so so good with a world so detailed. I love that we get to follow and see bits and pieces from the enemy's point of view, it is really interesting.

Minor spoiler ahead : the trip to Shadesmar is so weird and fantastic it is fascinating to follow our heroes over there. The ending (you can even say endings, there is a really great part ending in the middle) are so well built up and Epic, with so much happening! Once again, this book takes the place of best book I have ever read.
