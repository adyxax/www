I just finished listening to the [Graphics Audio](https://www.graphicaudiointernational.net/the-stormlight-archive-1-download-series-set.html) adaptation of [The Way of Kings]({{< ref "the-way-of-kings" >}}). I must say it was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend. These audiobooks are quite expensive but are really on another level of realization and play with many actors giving life to the characters and action.

It was a joy to go through this book again three and a half years later. After reading all the Cosmere books, starting anew looking for details I missed on my first read was really engaging in particular thanks to this new format.
