I just finished listening to the [Graphics Audio](https://www.graphicaudiointernational.net/the-stormlight-archive-2-download-series-set.html) adaptation of [Words of Radiance]({{< ref "words-of-radiance" >}}). Just like for [The Way of Kings]({{< ref "the-way-of-kings-audiobook" >}}), I must say it was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend. The level of realization is just as good, and they kept the same actors! I was afraid the voices might not be consistent from one book to the next, but they were!

It was a joy to go through this book again three and a half years later. I got so many details and references that I missed on my first read, I really recommend engaging in such an experience with this new format.
