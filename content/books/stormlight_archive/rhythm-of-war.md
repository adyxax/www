Another book, another masterpiece! Brandon Sanderson is so consistent at amazing me with this book series, it is incredible how good it feels to read the stories of the various heroes and villains. I particularly enjoyed the take on depression and trauma, such a difficult thing to portray well, and the climax of the story!

Raboniel is such a good villain, so well written! Leshwi too, and even if I liked the Pursuer he could not compete. The exploration of the physics of stormlight and voidlight in this world is really satisfying too, I cannot wait to see how all of this will go in the next book.
