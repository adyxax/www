Words of Radiance is a perfect sequel to [The Way Of Kings]({{< ref "the-way-of-kings" >}}) : the characters continue to grow, the world gets more detailed, complex and intriguing, and the final is the definition of Epic (yes, in this context the word epic deserves a capital E).

It is almost ridiculous how good this book is. I wrote that The Way of Kings was the best book I ever read, but that is not true anymore... That is how great the Stormlight Archive series is. If you have not already, do yourself a favor and start reading this masterpiece!
