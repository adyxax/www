I listened to the Graphics Audio adaptation of [Rhythm Of War]({{< ref "rhythm-of-war" >}}). Just like for the previous audio books, I must say it was a very immersive experience that I highly recommend. The level of realization is just even higher than before which great effect and work done to act the rhythms of the listener people's tongue! I was taken aback by the voice of Shallan being different but got used to it.
