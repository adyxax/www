I listened to the Graphics Audio adaptation of [Oathbringer]({{< ref "oathbringer" >}}). Just like for the previous audio books, I must say it was a great experience that I highly recommend. The level of realization is just as good, and they kept the same actors! And to my delight, it was again the same narrator as the first stormlight archive books!
