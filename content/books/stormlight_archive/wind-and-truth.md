Another book, another epic story! Brandon Sanderson continues to amaze me with
this book series, though this one stretched my idea of what a single book can
be! Do not get me wrong, I do not complain about getting too much story: it just
took me longer than I thought!

I enjoyed all the characters' arcs, but Adolin's was the best. His struggles
were particularly intense! I also feel that Szeth's and Sygzil's stories stood
out. This was a really epic story and I cannot wait for book six.
