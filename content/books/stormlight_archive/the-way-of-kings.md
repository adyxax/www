Simply put, the way of kings might very well be the best book I have ever read. The story, the characters, the world building... It is just that good!

Granted the book is as long as the Lord of the Ring trilogy, but time flies while reading it. The action scenes are particularly well written and intense, but the descriptions and sceneries are great in their own way : really detailed and easy to picture. You really struggle along with Kaladin, feel with Shallan and doubt with Dalinar. Do yourself a favor and start reading the Prologue, you will be hooked before the end of the chapter!
