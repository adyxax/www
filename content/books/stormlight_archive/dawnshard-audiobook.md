I listened to the Graphics Audio adaptation of [Dawnshard]({{< ref "dawnshard" >}}). Just like for the previous audio books, I must say it was a great experience that I highly recommend. The level of realization is just as good, and they kept the same actors! They changed the narrator again though, but though I still prefer the one from the first stormlight books I also like this one.:w
