I listened to the Graphics Audio adaptation of [Edgedancer]({{< ref "edgedancer" >}}). Just like for the previous audio books, I must say it was a great experience that I highly recommend. The level of realization is just as good, and they kept the same actors! The only disappointment comes from the narrator being a different person: he was not bad, but I did not care for him and missed the previous one.
