This is the sixth book in the Witcher sage. It takes place a few months after the events in [Baptism of Fire]({{< ref baptism-of-fire >}}) and changes the naration a bit. The story of one of the main characters gets told in flashbacks which is quite a change from the previous stories but not in a bad way. I continued to enjoy the adventures of the Witcher and its companions and could not wait to read the last book : [Lady of the Lake]({{< ref lady-of-the-lake >}}).
