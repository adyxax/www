This is the fourth book in the Witcher saga and in direct continuation of [The Blood of Elves]({{< ref blood-of-elves >}}). The events really take a turn in this book, so much happens in such a (relatively) short time!

All the preparations and settings from the previous books come into play in this one, I had a great time reading it.
