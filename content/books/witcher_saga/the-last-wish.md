The Witcher saga was recommended to me many years ago by dear friends.

With my renewed passion for reading and the upcoming netflix series I dived into The Last Wish.
The world building is great and I loved that the only point of view we get is Geralt : if something important happens and Geralt is not there to witness it, you will not know about it before he does.

I instantly knew that I would enjoy the whole book series.
