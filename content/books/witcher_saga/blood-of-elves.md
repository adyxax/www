This is the third book in the Witcher saga and the first one which is not just composed of short stories. You will still mainly follow Geralt, but you will occasionally follow other characters point of view from now on. I really enjoyed this viewpoint limitation in the first two books, but I feel it was necessary to expand on it a bit like the author has done.

Not a lot happens but it is still well written and action packed... and boy the amount of things we learn about the world and its history!
