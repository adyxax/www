This seventh book takes off right after the events in [The Tower of Swallows]({{< ref the-tower-of-swallows >}}) and concludes the Witcher saga in an explosive way. So many events and machinations finally reach their conclusion after so many books. The author managed to exceed my expectations by having all the characters converge towards the end in such a satisfying way.

I highly recommend this series of books!
