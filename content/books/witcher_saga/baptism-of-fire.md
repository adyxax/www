This is the fifth book in the Witcher saga. It takes off right after the explosive events of [Time of Comtempt]({{< ref time-of-contempt >}}) and slows things down a little. I guess I liked this book a little less because of that but it is still a good book. Besides in this one is introduced one of my favourite secondary characters : Regis!
