This is the second book in the Witcher saga. It is a great sequel to [The Last Wish]({{< ref the-last-wish >}}) and like this first book is composed of short stories that are packed with action and well written.

Your knowledge of the world and its history expands as Geralt travels. It is really immersive and I highly recommend it.
