This is an isolated novel in the Witcher universe which was release many years after [Lady of the Lake]({{< ref lady-of-the-lake >}}). I did not know it existed before finishing this last Witcher book and was pleased to stumble upon it.

It is a short story that takes place before the events of the saga, somewhere in between some of the stories in the first two books. Even though it is a short read I thoroughly enjoyed reading this last bit of story of Geralt of Rivia. I guess if I want any more witcher stories I will have no choice over than playing the games now.
