{{< blocks/cover title="Welcome to Yet Another SysAdmin Wiki!" image_anchor="top" height="full" color="orange">}}
You can see this wiki as an aggregation of various information (but almost always SysAdmin related) and stuff I gathered around the Internet. When I have to work on something that needed some research, I put there a sum up of what I
have done, all along with personal thoughts. There will be documentation articles and maybe some blog posts if the documentation article is not suitable.

Well I hope you feel welcome here. I accept all good wills that might be motivated to add some material here. Do not hesitate to leave a message at adyxax -AT- adyxax.org, asking for
a translation or whatever ;-)
