  I switched my personal wiki from dokuwiki to Hugo
---

This is the website you are currently reading. It is a static website built using hugo. This article details how I installed hugo, how I initialised this website and how I manage it. I often refer to it as wiki.adyxax.org because I hosted a unique dokuwiki for a long time as my main website (and a pmwiki before that), but with hugo it has become more than that. It is now a mix of wiki, blog and showcase of my work and interests.

[Here is the link to the full article describing how I achieved that.]({{< relref "/docs/adyxax.org/services/www.md" >}})
