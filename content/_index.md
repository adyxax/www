Hello, my name is Julien Dessaux.

This website is as an aggregation of various thoughts and tutorials about open source, BSD and GNU/Linux system administration, and networking. It is a personal space that I try to fill up with my experience and knowledge of computer systems and network administration. You can learn more about me [on this page]({{< relref "/docs/about-me/_index.md" >}})

I hope you feel welcome here, do not hesitate to leave a message at julien -DOT- dessaux -AT- adyxax -DOT- org. You can ask for a translation, some more details on a topic covered here, or just say hi or whatever ;-)

Have a good time!
